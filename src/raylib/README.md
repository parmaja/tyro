### Interduce ###

Header translation of [raylib 3.5](https://www.raylib.com/) for videogames programming, compiled in FPC and Delphi, Dynamic loading dll, with wrapping classes to make it easy to use.

### Compile ###

Use fpc 3.2 or Delphi XE 10 to compile, we have a problem in Delphi for struct as return from function, read "struct" section in this article

http://rvelthuis.de/articles/articles-dlls.html

for that 8 bytes struct declared as int64 result then typecast it to that struct.
